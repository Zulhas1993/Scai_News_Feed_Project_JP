    "article": "An article by Itsuki, an insider at a food manufacturer, tackles the commonly misunderstood and often disliked food additive: emulsifiers. Emulsifiers are frequently used in processed foods and share components with surfactants found in detergents, leading to misconceptions about their safety and purpose. The article clarifies that interfaces are simply the boundaries between two substances, such as air and skin, or water and oil. Emulsifiers work at these boundaries to mix substances that would not ordinarily combine, like oil and vinegar in mayonnaise. Natural emulsifiers exist, such as proteins and phospholipids in milk, and emulsification is a process that can enhance the texture and mouthfeel of food products by making them smoother and creamier. The article dispels myths, explaining that food emulsifiers are often derived from natural sources and have functionalities based on their affinity for water or oil.

    "article": "As Tetris celebrates its 40th anniversary in 2024, its creator, Alexey Pajitnov, shares his thoughts in an interview with Game*Spark. He expresses his joy in seeing Tetris become recognized as an esport, a dream he and his team had harbored. Despite challenges in player engagement due to the intense focus required to play, Pajitnov is optimistic about the game's future in competitive play and is working on solutions. He explains his choice of the seven \"tetrimino\" shapes over the traditional 12 pentomino shapes as a means to simplify the game for casual players. Pajitnov also acknowledges research suggesting Tetris can reduce flashbacks in PTSD patients and hopes the game can eventually be used in the treatment of serious illnesses. He mentions enjoying recent Tetris titles like \"Tetris Effect\" and \"TETRIS 99\" and avoids commenting on unauthorized games. Finally, Pajitnov discusses his involvement in the Tetris movie, ensuring its authenticity, despite dramatic embellishments for entertainment value.\n\nTitle: Maximizing Knowledge Retention Through Notetaking\nLink: https://blog.shibayu36.org/entry/2024/02/19/173000\nArticle:\nA blogger describes a new reading strategy that has improved their ability to absorb and recall information. The process involves selecting books on a desired topic, highlighting interesting parts while reading, reviewing and re-highlighting the most compelling sections, and then transcribing these insights into reading notes. The most critical realization for the blogger was that true comprehension only occurred during the note-taking phase, where the material finally clicked and sparked relevant ideas for work application. The blogger emphasizes that this method, while potentially limiting the number of books read, ensures the retention and meaningful assimilation of knowledge.\n\nTitle: Ishikawa Prefecture's Controversial Budget Allocation for \"Osaka Expo\" Sparks Public Outrage\nLink: https://smart-flash.jp/sociopolitics/274262/1/1/\nArticle:\nIshikawa Prefecture's Governor Horoshi Hase's endorsement of the Osaka Expo has ignited social media backlash. The controversy escalated when the prefecture's budget proposal included a 10 million yen allocation for \"promoting international cultural exchange\" ahead of the expo, despite the need for earthquake disaster recovery. The allocation plans to dispatch cultural groups to Jeollabuk-do in South Korea. Citizens expressed their anger and confusion over why prefectural funds were being used for the expo instead of local recovery efforts, especially considering the governor's affiliation with the political party Nippon Ishin no Kai and his close ties with its key leaders.\n\nTitle: \"Tone Bookstore,\" a Successful Chain in Ibaraki Prefecture, Celebrates 25 Years and Continuous Growth\nLink: https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000043.000084226.html\nArticle:\nPrima Vera Co., Ltd., celebrating its 25th anniversary, has achieved 14 consecutive terms of revenue and profit growth, partially due to the success of \"Tone Bookstore\" in Ibaraki Prefecture.

It argues that acknowledging one's own ignorance and being able to explain a concept to others are key steps in the learning process. The \"knowledge to pretend\" (知ったかbility) increases as one deepens their understanding of a subject. The author emphasizes that hands-on practice and explaining to others are crucial for solidifying knowledge. The article encourages using \"pretending to know\" as a constructive strategy to evaluate one's understanding and to progress towards becoming a stronger engineer. The author shares personal experiences of how visualizing knowledge helped clarify understanding and improve work efficiency.",

    "article": "As Tetris celebrates its 40th anniversary in 2024, its creator, Alexey Pajitnov, shares his thoughts in an interview with Game*Spark. He expresses his joy in seeing Tetris become recognized as an esport, a dream he and his team had harbored. Despite challenges in player engagement due to the intense focus required to play, Pajitnov is optimistic about the game's future in competitive play and is working on solutions. He explains his choice of the seven \"tetrimino\" shapes over the traditional 12 pentomino shapes as a means to simplify the game for casual players. Pajitnov also acknowledges research suggesting Tetris can reduce flashbacks in PTSD patients and hopes the game can eventually be used in the treatment of serious illnesses. He mentions enjoying recent Tetris titles like \"Tetris Effect\" and \"TETRIS 99\" and avoids commenting on unauthorized games. Finally, Pajitnov discusses his involvement in the Tetris movie, ensuring its authenticity, despite dramatic embellishments for entertainment value.\n\nTitle: Maximizing Knowledge Retention Through Notetaking\nLink: https://blog.shibayu36.org/entry/2024/02/19/173000\nArticle:\nA blogger describes a new reading strategy that has improved their ability to absorb and recall information.

The tweet cited in the article suggests that even an average IQ of 100 may not be sufficient to navigate the complexities of modern life, leading to increased visits to psychiatrists and therapists. The author argues that the threshold for struggling in contemporary society is not just a matter of IQ but also the ability to discern the veracity of information, understand complex contracts and systems, and make well-informed decisions. With the expectation for citizens to utilize investment schemes like iDeCo and NISA, the implied cognitive demand is high.

However, employees are finding ways around these restrictions by using their personal AI subscriptions on their smartphones, a practice referred to as \"Bring Your Own AI\" (BYOAI). Analysts from Forrester predict that by 2024, 60% of employees will use their own AI to accomplish work tasks. This shift from Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) to BYOAI suggests that employees may be allowed to use their contracted AI tools for work within certain guidelines, reflecting a pragmatic approach to the inevitable use of personal AI in business operations.",

He acknowledged the \"shameful\" act, which tore families apart and stripped them of their dignity, and vowed \"Nidoto Nai Yoni\" (Let it not happen again). The internment was a result of President Roosevelt's order following the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941, which labeled Japanese Americans as \"enemy aliens\" and led to their forced relocation and incarceration.\n\nTitle: Master the Console: A Guide for Better Debugging and Development - Qiita\nLink: https://qiita.com/S4nTo/items/453b5e6ee933765211ec\nArticle:\nThe article introduces various console methods, extending beyond the commonly used console.log(), to enhance debugging and development in web development.

In 2022, approximately 15,000 people in the child-rearing generation (ages 25-44) moved out of Tokyo, outpacing those moving in. The same trend was observed among children aged 0-14. The white paper suggests this \"Tokyo exodus\" could negatively impact women's employment rates due to longer commutes. It also notes the possibility of families forgoing additional children due to the high cost and limited space of Tokyo housing. The government is considering measures such as increasing public housing supply to support child-rearing households and improve work-life balance.\n\nTitle: Lawyer's Perspective on Matsumoto Hitoshi's Lawsuit\nLink: https://anond.hatelabo.jp/20240219174650\nArticle:\nA lawyer's commentary suggests that comedian Matsumoto Hitoshi is likely to win his defamation lawsuit against the weekly magazine Shukan Bunshun. The key point is the magazine's need to demonstrate truth equivalence, which would heavily rely on the testimony of the alleged victim. However, the victim may choose not to appear in court as there is no benefit for her, and the risk of perjury charges would be high. Without the victim's testimony, the magazine's defense is weakened, and the outcome is predicted to favor Matsumoto. The commentary also highlights that subsequent reports of sexual assault allegations without a clear victim further diminish the magazine’s chances.

The circumstances of Navalny's death are under procedural investigation, and there have been international calls questioning the Russian authorities' account that he became unwell after returning from a walk.

    "article": "\"Shiren the Wanderer 6,\" a Nintendo Switch rogue-like game, was released on January 25, 2024, by Spike Chunsoft after a decade-long hiatus. While the game has been hailed as the best installment yet by many fans, one critic has voiced opposition, feeling disappointed by what they consider a rough and uninspired design. The critic, who has completed the game's challenging \"Serpentcoil Island\" dungeon multiple times, argues that the game suffers from a poor user interface (UI), substandard settings, and an overall lack of polish that should have been identified with proper playtesting. This critique extends to various gameplay aspects, such as visibility issues, convoluted live display settings, and awkward controls. The author hopes that by pointing out these flaws, they can encourage both acknowledgment of the game's problems and potential updates from the developers. Despite the controversy, the critic admits to enjoying aspects of the game but remains frustrated by the numerous elements they find lacking.\n\nTitle: Japan's Digital Agency to End COVID-19 Vaccination Proof App Service in March\nLink: https://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/2402/20/news110.html\nArticle:\nJapan's Digital Agency announced on February 20th that the service for the \"COVID-19 Vaccination Proof App\" will be terminated at the end of March. The decision comes as the need for vaccination certificates has greatly diminished, both domestically and for international travel. The app, released on December 21, 2021, allowed users with a My Number card and an NFC-enabled smartphone to obtain electronic certificates for both domestic and international use by querying the \"VRS\" system, which manages citizens' vaccination information. The app's certificate issuance function will be halted on April 1, 2024, and the app will be removed from stores by May 7.

While the game has been hailed as the best installment yet by many fans, one critic has voiced opposition, feeling disappointed by what they consider a rough and uninspired design. The critic, who has completed the game's challenging \"Serpentcoil Island\" dungeon multiple times, argues that the game suffers from a poor user interface (UI), substandard settings, and an overall lack of polish that should have been identified with proper playtesting. This critique extends to various gameplay aspects, such as visibility issues, convoluted live display settings, and awkward controls. The author hopes that by pointing out these flaws, they can encourage both acknowledgment of the game's problems and potential updates from the developers. Despite the controversy, the critic admits to enjoying aspects of the game but remains frustrated by the numerous elements they find lacking.\n\nTitle: Japan's Digital Agency to End COVID-19 Vaccination Proof App Service in March\nLink: https://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/2402/20/news110.html\nArticle:\nJapan's Digital Agency announced on February 20th that the service for the \"COVID-19 Vaccination Proof App\" will be terminated at the end of March.

It also warns that older adults are more susceptible to alcohol due to decreased body water content, which could lead to dementia when exceeding certain amounts. Young adults in their teens and twenties face a heightened risk of diminished brain function due to excessive drinking, which could escalate the risk of hypertension.

Kito highlighted that a fair pursuit of truth would involve suing the media as well, and the response from Shukan Shincho, the news outlet reporting on the issue, will be closely watched. In a subsequent post, Kito mentioned that if the court deems the lawsuit unjust, it could lead to a counterclaim, potentially resulting in Ito and his lawyer, Hirotaro Kato, being ordered to pay damages instead.",

The firm, which actively advertised on TV and the internet, handled over 10,000 requests for services such as claims for the return of overpaid debt and compensation for B-type hepatitis patients. However, after declaring bankruptcy in June 2020, it was found that only about 500 million yen remained from the 30 billion yen in client funds.

The current impasse stems from the substantial changes in the industry due to the rise of streaming services, which have altered traditional business models.

A Ukrainian man in his 30s, with a wife and two daughters abroad, has chosen to return to university partly for education and partly to evade military service. The number of men aged 30-39 enrolling in university has increased 20-fold since before the invasion, hinting at widespread draft avoidance. Despite the challenges posed by this situation, Ukrainian military expert Oleksandr Musiienko asserts that the current level of draft avoidance does not yet impact troop strength but emphasizes the need for improved public perception of military service and better treatment of soldiers.\n\n---\n\nTitle: Kobe Tokushukai Hospital Ordered to Improve After Patient Deaths\nLink: https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/3b5003004c105cf695c04d039465139dd4c81746\nArticle:\nKobe Tokushukai Hospital has been issued an improvement order after a series of patient deaths, including a diabetic man in his 70s who died after not receiving insulin. His condition was overlooked by his doctor, who was also the hospital director, and the family was incorrectly informed that pneumonia was the cause of death. Furthermore, following catheter procedures by a single physician, 11 patients died, leading to prior administrative guidance from Kobe City. Despite this, the hospital showed no signs of improvement, prompting the city to issue its first-ever improvement order based on the Medical Care Act in Hyogo Prefecture.

    "article": "In the last 20 years, the number of communal graves set up by local governments in the Tokyo metropolitan area has quadrupled. Chiba City, for example, installed its first municipal communal grave in 2013 and added a new tree burial type last year. An overwhelming number of applications were received this year, exceeding the initial offering of 700 spots by more than five times. The option to apply for a plot for two people, such as a couple, proved to be particularly popular, with over 2,300 applications for just 60 spots, resulting in a competition rate of over 38 times. While individual gravesites can be quite expensive, with costs starting at around 620,000 yen plus annual maintenance fees of 5,020 yen, the tree burial type communal graves are much more affordable at 40,000 to 60,000 yen per person without annual fees. Applicants expressed their desire to avoid burdening their children with grave maintenance and were surprised by the high demand, reflecting the times. A 76-year-old woman, having been unsuccessful in previous applications, was relieved to finally secure a spot without a lottery on her fifth attempt.

The proposed revision includes a special provision allowing the national government to issue necessary instructions to local authorities without specific legislation during significant emergencies such as large-scale disasters or the spread of infectious diseases. The revision process faced concerns from the National Governors' Association about the potential for undermining the equal relationship between the national and local governments. Consequently, the draft includes clauses requiring the government to seek input and provide information to municipalities before issuing directives. The government aims to pass the bill in the current session of the Diet.\n\nTitle: MP Sugita Mio Praises Imperial Rescript on Education, Claims It Contains 'Nothing Odd'\nLink: https://nordot.app/1132244616457487208\nArticle:\nLiberal Democratic Party lawmaker Sugita Mio has publicly praised the Imperial Rescript on Education, a document historically tied to wartime militaristic education in Japan. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), she stated that there is \"nothing odd\" written in the rescript. Her remarks contradict the post-war House of Representatives resolution from 1948, which confirmed the exclusion of the Imperial Rescript on Education. Sugita's statement is seen as an effort to appeal to some conservative factions. The Rescript, which fostered loyalty to the Emperor as a \"living god,\" has been criticized for driving many youths into tragic wars. Despite this, Sugita emphasized the moral aspects of the Rescript, such as filial piety and marital harmony, suggesting that teaching it in homes and schools could help prevent child abuse and bullying.\n\nTitle: \"Doraemon's Sister\" Doraemi-chan Manga: No Bath Scene, But Still Fantastic\nLink: https://delete-all.hatenablog.com/entry/2024/02/20/060000\nArticle:\nThe manga \"Doraemi-chan,\" a spin-off of the beloved \"Doraemon\" series, has been praised for its unique take on the original characters and storyline. Although the author is not an avid Doraemon fanatic, the enjoyment of the Doraemi-chan world compiled into a 240-page volume was highly appreciated. The character Doraemi-chan serves as a fresh element, differing from Doraemon in personality, and introduces variety to the narrative. The manga provides a parallel world to the Doraemon universe and includes characters with slightly altered names and roles. Some stories have not been fully corrected for consistency, adding to the charm of the series. The book also avoids the overused bath scene punchline, which may appeal to certain online communities. Despite Doraemi-chan's limited appearances in the main Doraemon series, the character has left a significant impact through memorable episodes.\n\nTitle: Chinese Tourists Puzzled by Decline in Japanese Service Quality Post-Pandemic\nLink: https://news.yahoo.co.jp/expert/articles/e851c0012a541cfad381f6341a34a37bc1e4c8e7\nArticle:\nChinese tourists who visited Japan during the recent Spring Festival have expressed concerns over a perceived decline in Japanese service quality. Despite overall satisfaction with their trips, multiple incidents raised eyebrows, such as overcharging at stores and communication issues in taxis. One couple recounted being overcharged at a small goods store, while another visitor experienced a pricing dispute over festival decorations. Additionally, two male tourists shared an unsettling experience with a taxi driver in Osaka. These accounts highlight a growing number of similar complaints, including clerical errors, misunderstandings in restaurants, and transportation troubles. While these stories represent only individual experiences and do not definitively indicate a downward trend in service, they reflect an increasing awareness and concern among returning visitors who previously held Japanese service in high regard.",

Some stories have not been fully corrected for consistency, adding to the charm of the series. The book also avoids the overused bath scene punchline, which may appeal to certain online communities. Despite Doraemi-chan's limited appearances in the main Doraemon series, the character has left a significant impact through memorable episodes.\n\nTitle: Chinese Tourists Puzzled by Decline in Japanese Service Quality Post-Pandemic\nLink: https://news.yahoo.co.jp/expert/articles/e851c0012a541cfad381f6341a34a37bc1e4c8e7\nArticle:\nChinese tourists who visited Japan during the recent Spring Festival have expressed concerns over a perceived decline in Japanese service quality. Despite overall satisfaction with their trips, multiple incidents raised eyebrows, such as overcharging at stores and communication issues in taxis. One couple recounted being overcharged at a small goods store, while another visitor experienced a pricing dispute over festival decorations. Additionally, two male tourists shared an unsettling experience with a taxi driver in Osaka. These accounts highlight a growing number of similar complaints, including clerical errors, misunderstandings in restaurants, and transportation troubles. While these stories represent only individual experiences and do not definitively indicate a downward trend in service, they reflect an increasing awareness and concern among returning visitors who previously held Japanese service in high regard.",

    "article": "In the last 20 years, the number of communal graves set up by local governments in the Tokyo metropolitan area has quadrupled. Chiba City, for example, installed its first municipal communal grave in 2013 and added a new tree burial type last year. An overwhelming number of applications were received this year, exceeding the initial offering of 700 spots by more than five times. The option to apply for a plot for two people, such as a couple, proved to be particularly popular, with over 2,300 applications for just 60 spots, resulting in a competition rate of over 38 times. While individual gravesites can be quite expensive, with costs starting at around 620,000 yen plus annual maintenance fees of 5,020 yen, the tree burial type communal graves are much more affordable at 40,000 to 60,000 yen per person without annual fees. Applicants expressed their desire to avoid burdening their children with grave maintenance and were surprised by the high demand, reflecting the times. A 76-year-old woman, having been unsuccessful in previous applications, was relieved to finally secure a spot without a lottery on her fifth attempt. She appreciated the communal grave concept, where even strangers would pay respects.\n\nTitle: Revision of the Local Autonomy Law to Allow National Government to Direct Municipalities in Emergencies\nLink: https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20240220/k10014364161000.html\nArticle:\nThe Japanese government has compiled a revision of the Local Autonomy Law, addressing coordination challenges between the national government and municipalities that became evident during the COVID-19 response. The proposed revision includes a special provision allowing the national government to issue necessary instructions to local authorities without specific legislation during significant emergencies such as large-scale disasters or the spread of infectious diseases. The revision process faced concerns from the National Governors' Association about the potential for undermining the equal relationship between the national and local governments. Consequently, the draft includes clauses requiring the government to seek input and provide information to municipalities before issuing directives. The government aims to pass the bill in the current session of the Diet.\n\nTitle: MP Sugita Mio Praises Imperial Rescript on Education, Claims It Contains 'Nothing Odd'\nLink: https://nordot.app/1132244616457487208\nArticle:\nLiberal Democratic Party lawmaker Sugita Mio has publicly praised the Imperial Rescript on Education, a document historically tied to wartime militaristic education in Japan. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), she stated that there is \"nothing odd\" written in the rescript. Her remarks contradict the post-war House of Representatives resolution from 1948, which confirmed the exclusion of the Imperial Rescript on Education. Sugita's statement is seen as an effort to appeal to some conservative factions. The Rescript, which fostered loyalty to the Emperor as a \"living god,\" has been criticized for driving many youths into tragic wars. Despite this, Sugita emphasized the moral aspects of the Rescript, such as filial piety and marital harmony, suggesting that teaching it in homes and schools could help prevent child abuse and bullying.\n\nTitle: \"Doraemon's Sister\" Doraemi-chan Manga: No Bath Scene, But Still Fantastic\nLink: https://delete-all.hatenablog.com/entry/2024/02/20/060000\nArticle:\nThe manga \"Doraemi-chan,\" a spin-off of the beloved \"Doraemon\" series, has been praised for its unique take on the original characters and storyline. Although the author is not an avid Doraemon fanatic, the enjoyment of the Doraemi-chan world compiled into a 240-page volume was highly appreciated. The character Doraemi-chan serves as a fresh element, differing from Doraemon in personality, and introduces variety to the narrative. The manga provides a parallel world to the Doraemon universe and includes characters with slightly altered names and roles. Some stories have not been fully corrected for consistency, adding to the charm of the series. The book also avoids the overused bath scene punchline, which may appeal to certain online communities.

Nikki Haley, a fellow Republican and former UN Ambassador, criticized Trump's ongoing amicable relationship with Putin in light of Navalny's death.\n\n---\n\nTitle: Constitutional Democratic Party Member Advocates for Ivermectin and Calls Vaccines Poison\nLink: [Unavailable]\nArticle:\nA member of Japan's Constitutional Democratic Party has called for the approval of Ivermectin and referred to vaccines as poison, sparking reactions among people who now express support for the party in elections. This stance reflects a significant shift from the party's traditionally liberal values, which have seemingly deteriorated over the past few years. The views are being spread by individuals awakened to such ideas, including a conspiracy theorist on Instagram with a substantial following. This fusion of party members and their supporters with conspiracy theorists indicates a concerning trend within the political landscape.\n\n---\n\nThe remaining news articles have either broken links or insufficient information to create a summary.",

    "title": "ラマダンまでに人質を帰さなければ「作戦拡大」　イスラエルが警告",
    "article": "Former Israeli Defense Minister and member of Israel's war cabinet, Benny Gantz, warned on March 18 that Israel would expand its military operations in the southern Gaza town of Rafah if hostages held by the Islamist organization Hamas are not returned before the start of Ramadan, which begins next month on the 10th or 11th. This is the first time Israel has set such a clear deadline for military action in Rafah. The town, near the Egyptian border, currently shelters over one million Palestinian residents. Israel is planning a ground operation in Rafah with the goal of annihilating Hamas. Gantz, speaking at a meeting of an American Jewish organization in Jerusalem, emphasized the possibility of an attack on Rafah, stating that it is something that both the world and Hamas leaders should be aware of. He also reiterated his stance on encouraging evacuation through dialogues with the U.S. and Egypt to minimize civilian casualties. Furthermore, he conveyed to those who argue the cost is too high that Hamas has the option to surrender and release the hostages, allowing Gaza residents to celebrate Ramadan.\n\nTitle: US Prepared to Veto Gaza Humanitarian Ceasefire Resolution at UN Security Council\nLink: https://www.cnn.co.jp/usa/35215427.html\nArticle:\nU.S. Ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, indicated that the United States would use its veto power if Algeria submits a resolution to the UN Security Council calling for a humanitarian ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. In a statement released on March 17, Thomas-Greenfield emphasized that negotiations for a six-week ceasefire and release of hostages between Israel and Hamas are progressing. She highlighted President Biden's efforts to promote these negotiations through multiple discussions with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and leaders from Egypt and Qatar. While gaps remain, key elements have been presented. She argued that the proposed deal is the best way to achieve a release of hostages and a long-term cessation of hostilities, allowing humanitarian aid to reach Palestinian civilians. In contrast, she contended that the resolution proposed to the Security Council would fail to achieve these objectives and might even be counterproductive. Thus, the U.S. does not support this resolution and will ensure it is not adopted. The Algerian resolution, supported by Arab countries since February 7, calls for an immediate ceasefire and unhindered humanitarian aid in Gaza.\n\nTitle: Somber Mood and Controversial Performances Overshadow China's Spring Festival\nLink: https://jbpress.ismedia.jp/articles/-/79439\nArticle:\nChina's Spring Festival (Lunar New Year) this year is enveloped in a somber mood rather than the usual celebratory atmosphere. The stock market crash at the end of January through early February has dampened the spirits of many Chinese citizens, making it difficult for them to feel festive. The Chinese version of the New Year's Eve song contest featured performances that reminded viewers of the \"Taiwan landing operation,\" adding to the unsettling mood. Rumors of a mass murder in a village have also contributed to the disquiet. During the Lunar New Year's Eve, many Chinese exchanged the message \"除夕快楽\" (meaning \"Happy New Year's Eve\"), which seems to carry an underlying, uneasy significance. The economic downturn and less frequent distribution of digital red envelopes on WeChat Pay have further diminished the New Year cheer. The stock market's sharp decline, referred to as the \"New Year stock disaster,\" reflects a profound lack of confidence in China's economic policies, with predictions of more turmoil after the festival. The report also touches on a sensational mass murder event in Shandong Province, which has been subject to strict information control, fueling speculation and highlighting the underlying tensions within Chinese society. Additionally, the article references the CCTV Spring Festival Gala, which has sparked controversy with its programming, reflecting the unease in China's social atmosphere.\n\nTitle: Prime Minister Kishida Addresses Allegations of Misuse of Political Funds by Former LDP Secretary-General Amari\nLink: https://www.tokyo-np.co.jp/article/309226\nArticle:\nJapan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida responded to concerns over the ¥380 million in political activity funds received by former Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Secretary-General Akira Amari during his 35-day tenure. Critics have calculated that this amount would require continuous spending of ¥450,000 per hour, 24 hours a day. Kishida asserted that the funds were properly handled and used for party expansion, policy formulation, and research corresponding to party positions. Since the funds were expended entirely on political activities, no tax declaration would be necessary. When questioned about the validity of the funds' usage, especially since Kishida himself, as the LDP president, made the payments, he maintained that they were appropriately processed. He also defended the lack of public disclosure of the funds' use, citing concerns over privacy, business freedom, and potential exploitation by external political forces or foreign entities. Addressing a report by the Chugoku Shimbun about Amari distributing ¥1 million to LDP-endorsed candidates during the 2019 House of Councillors election, Kishida was pressed on whether the political activity funds were illegally distributed as \"slush funds\" during the 2021 House of Representatives election. He reiterated his belief that the funds were used appropriately, although he was not aware of the specific report. The issue of political activity funds has also involved LDP member Toshihiro Nikai, who received a total of ¥1.069 billion from the party headquarters in 2020 and 2021.\n\nTitle: Itochu to End Collaboration with Israeli Defense Company Elbit Systems Following International Court Ruling\nLink: https://toyokeizai.net/articles/-/735006\nArticle:\nDuring an earnings conference on February 5, Itochu Corporation's CFO Takeshi Hachimura announced that the company will terminate its cooperation with Israeli defense firm Elbit Systems by the end of February. Itochu had been importing products from Elbit Systems, which has been operating at full capacity since hostilities began in Gaza last October, to supply to Japan's Defense Ministry. The decision to end the relationship comes amidst increasing protests, both domestically and internationally, against Itochu's partnership with a military company as casualties rise in Gaza. A pivotal moment in Itochu's decision was the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) issuance of \"provisional measures orders\" against Israel on January 26. These measures stem from the accusation that Israel's ongoing siege and attacks in Gaza, which have resulted in over 28,000 Palestinian deaths and a humanitarian crisis due to blockades, could constitute genocide under the Genocide Convention. South Africa initiated the legal action against Israel on this different perspective. Although the ICJ's final judgment on whether Israel's actions constitute intentional genocide may take years, the provisional measures order is a historic move to prevent genocide. However, the order does not include an immediate ceasefire, as was the first request by South Africa, causing some international disappointment. The article ponders the impact of these provisional measures on the conflict in Gaza and explores why South Africa has taken legal action against Israel.",

Additionally, the article references the CCTV Spring Festival Gala, which has sparked controversy with its programming, reflecting the unease in China's social atmosphere.\n\nTitle: Prime Minister Kishida Addresses Allegations of Misuse of Political Funds by Former LDP Secretary-General Amari\nLink: https://www.tokyo-np.co.jp/article/309226\nArticle:\nJapan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida responded to concerns over the ¥380 million in political activity funds received by former Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Secretary-General Akira Amari during his 35-day tenure. Critics have calculated that this amount would require continuous spending of ¥450,000 per hour, 24 hours a day. Kishida asserted that the funds were properly handled and used for party expansion, policy formulation, and research corresponding to party positions. Since the funds were expended entirely on political activities, no tax declaration would be necessary. When questioned about the validity of the funds' usage, especially since Kishida himself, as the LDP president, made the payments, he maintained that they were appropriately processed. He also defended the lack of public disclosure of the funds' use, citing concerns over privacy, business freedom, and potential exploitation by external political forces or foreign entities. Addressing a report by the Chugoku Shimbun about Amari distributing ¥1 million to LDP-endorsed candidates during the 2019 House of Councillors election, Kishida was pressed on whether the political activity funds were illegally distributed as \"slush funds\" during the 2021 House of Representatives election. He reiterated his belief that the funds were used appropriately, although he was not aware of the specific report. The issue of political activity funds has also involved LDP member Toshihiro Nikai, who received a total of ¥1.069 billion from the party headquarters in 2020 and 2021.\n\nTitle: Itochu to End Collaboration with Israeli Defense Company Elbit Systems Following International Court Ruling\nLink: https://toyokeizai.net/articles/-/735006\nArticle:\nDuring an earnings conference on February 5, Itochu Corporation's CFO Takeshi Hachimura announced that the company will terminate its cooperation with Israeli defense firm Elbit Systems by the end of February. Itochu had been importing products from Elbit Systems, which has been operating at full capacity since hostilities began in Gaza last October, to supply to Japan's Defense Ministry. The decision to end the relationship comes amidst increasing protests, both domestically and internationally, against Itochu's partnership with a military company as casualties rise in Gaza. A pivotal moment in Itochu's decision was the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) issuance of \"provisional measures orders\" against Israel on January 26. These measures stem from the accusation that Israel's ongoing siege and attacks in Gaza, which have resulted in over 28,000 Palestinian deaths and a humanitarian crisis due to blockades, could constitute genocide under the Genocide Convention. South Africa initiated the legal action against Israel on this different perspective. Although the ICJ's final judgment on whether Israel's actions constitute intentional genocide may take years, the provisional measures order is a historic move to prevent genocide. However, the order does not include an immediate ceasefire, as was the first request by South Africa, causing some international disappointment. The article ponders the impact of these provisional measures on the conflict in Gaza and explores why South Africa has taken legal action against Israel.",

Although investment returned to a positive $17.5 billion in the October to December period, the annual figure was still only about 10% of the peak in 2021. The reduction in investment can be attributed to intensified U.S.-led export controls on advanced technologies, increased economic restrictions within China prioritizing national security, and the prolonged real estate slump that casts doubt on China's market growth potential. These factors have led foreign companies to become more cautious about investing in China.\n\nTitle: Real Jail Sentences for Participants in Alexei Navalny's Memorial Rally in Russia\nLink: https://www.afpbb.com/articles/-/3505652\nArticle:\nA court in St. Petersburg, Russia, has sentenced 154 individuals to up to 14 days in jail for participating in unauthorized rallies, including a memorial for opposition leader Alexei Navalny. The sentences, revealed through documents published on February 17 and 18, reflect a broader trend of similar rulings across Russia. The detainees were arrested for laying flowers and candles at a monument for victims of political repression, commemorating Navalny, who passed away on February 16. The Russian government has not commented on Navalny's death, and President Vladimir Putin remains silent on the matter.

The EU competition authority concluded that Apple hindered competitors like Spotify from informing users about cheaper alternatives outside the App Store, violating EU antitrust laws. This marks the first time the EU will fine Apple. Despite Apple's claim that Spotify became the most popular music streaming service in Europe with the help of the App Store, the EU's investigation, initiated by a complaint from Spotify nearly four years ago, has led to this significant penalty. Apple has addressed the competitive concerns raised by Spotify, but the EU appears unconvinced.\n\nTitle: Israeli Raid on Nasser Hospital in Gaza Results in 8 Deaths\nLink: https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20240219/k10014363121000.html\nArticle:\nIsraeli forces raided Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, Gaza, suspecting Hamas militants’ activity and a potential hostage situation. The operation, which began on February 15 and continued on the 18th, resulted in the Israeli military claiming to have discovered weapons and detaining about 70 Hamas combatants. However, Gaza health authorities assert that those detained are medical staff. The hospital suffered a power outage, leading to the death of 8 patients and putting many more at risk. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus highlighted the dire situation, calling for the urgent evacuation of patients. Amid ongoing airstrikes, Gaza health authorities report a total of 2,8985 deaths. Brazilian President Lula da Silva condemned the situation as \"genocide,\" prompting a strong rebuke from Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, who criticized Lula for demeaning the memory of Holocaust victims and vilifying the Jewish state.",

In response, the Constitutional Democratic Party held an emergency executive meeting on February 19th to discuss the situation with party leaders. Subsequently, they submitted a no-confidence motion against Minister Moriyama to the House of Representatives, arguing that due to his close ties with the religious group currently under scrutiny by his own ministry, it is impossible for the public to have confidence in his impartiality. The motion accuses him of giving untrustworthy responses in the Diet and deems him unfit for his ministerial position. The resolution is expected to be voted on in the House of Representatives plenary session on February 20th.\n\nTitle: Concerns Over Pet Rehoming Posts on Japanese Local Community Site Jimoty\nLink: https://togetter.com/li/2317796\nArticle:\nOn the local community website Jimoty, users have expressed surprise and sadness at the number of posts seeking new homes for pets due to non-pet-friendly living arrangements. The listings often come from pet owners who, despite needing to give up their pets, specify wanting to find someone who will cherish them. Commentary on the site notes that while some pet owners may seek pet-friendly housing, there are various reasons why others may not be able to, including regional scarcity of such accommodations. This leads to concerns about pets potentially being left in less than ideal situations.

The critique extends to other drinks, such as ume (plum) liqueur, which the commenter feels is deceptively labeled since it is not made by fermenting plums but is rather a type of shochu (Japanese distilled beverage) flavored with plums.

The realization that, even with a generous life expectancy, the time available for leisure activities is finite, leads to the conclusion that prioritizing interests and managing time effectively is crucial. The post has resonated with others who feel the pressure to balance entertainment, work, and personal development in a modern world saturated with abundant content and experiences.\n\nTitle: Easy-to-Clean Stainless Steel Dome Steamer for Cooking Beginners\nLink: https://soredoko.jp/entry/2024/02/20/103000\nArticle:\nA stainless steel dome-shaped steamer available from cooking expert Harumi Kurihara's kitchenware brand has been highlighted for its convenience and ease of use, especially for those new to cooking.

    "article": "A financial sector employee and solo camping enthusiast from Kanagawa solved a common camping problem with an innovative item from Evernew, a company known for its outdoor products. The \"U.L. Cleaner,\" also nicknamed \"Pelotan,\" is a nylon cleaner that weighs a mere 7g and comes with a storage bag, making it an ideal, compact solution for outdoor dishwashing. Unlike traditional sponges and detergents, this cleaner's special weave structure allows for scrubbing without the need for soap, though stubborn grease may still require some detergent. Its two-sided design offers a rough side for tough stains and a soft side for coated pans. Although the cleaner is not a complete substitute for soap, it significantly simplifies the dishwashing process, especially for ultralight campers. This product has been praised for its portability and effectiveness, offering a convenient way to maintain cleanliness while enjoying the great outdoors.\n\nTitle: Husband Transforms from Monosyllabic to Trisyllabic Speaker Post-Marriage\nLink: https://togetter.com/li/2317490\nArticle:\nA woman remarked humorously on social media that her husband, who she referred to as a \"33-year-old child,\" used to only be able to say \"delicious\" before they got married. However, once married, he developed the ability to say \"different from mom's taste,\" expanding his vocabulary to three words. This light-hearted anecdote highlights the change in communication dynamics within a relationship once it transitions from dating to marriage, perhaps due to the husband's increased comfort and willingness to express more detailed opinions about home-cooked meals.\n\nTitle: The Charm and Caution of Living in the Osakan District of Nishinari\nLink: https://suumo.jp/town/entry/nishinari-tanijako/\nArticle:\nTani Jaco, a poet residing in Nishinari, Osaka, reflects on her experiences growing up and living in the area known for its rough reputation. In her essay, she talks about the district's warmth and kindness, despite its notorious image. She mentions the former Izumiya store, which was central to her childhood memories, and the Tsurumibashi shopping street, which has been a part of her life. While acknowledging the district's aging population and the closure of many familiar stores, she also notes the emergence of new and trendy businesses. Tani Jaco's narrative captures the essence of Nishinari, a place with both good and bad aspects, suggesting it's not so different from other neighborhoods.\n\nTitle: Grandma Dodges Biting Cat with Surprising Agility\nLink: https://togetter.com/li/2317542\nArticle:\nA granddaughter shared a humorous observation about her grandmother and her pet cat on social media. She noted that her grandmother believed the cat was a \"smart, non-biting\" creature. However, upon closer inspection, it became apparent that the cat was indeed prone to biting, but the grandmother's excellent reflexes allowed her to effortlessly dodge every attack. This revelation amused the granddaughter, as it showcased her grandmother's unexpectedly sharp movements, making it seem as though the cat was indeed well-behaved.\n\nTitle: A Fun Twist on Fried Foods: The Digital Remastering of Changing Batter\nLink: https://dailyportalz.jp/kiji/change-batter-fried-food\nArticle:\nAn experimental cooking session led to the \"remastering\" of various fried foods by changing their batter. Traditional dishes like croquettes, katsu, and fried ham were transformed by replacing their usual coatings with tempura batter and vice versa. The experiment revealed interesting taste profiles, such as the delicate flavor of oyster tempura with salt, which contrasted with the robust taste of oyster fry with sauce. The versatility of ingredients like sweet potatoes and quail eggs was also explored, highlighting how a simple change in batter can create a new culinary experience. Although not all \"remastered\" dishes surpassed their original versions, the exercise offered a playful and insightful look into the role of batter in fried cuisine.",

    "article": "A Twitter user named Rbzm (@robs_zoom_) noticed a peculiar flyer in their mailbox that appeared to be in Thai, despite living in Japan. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be a Domino's Pizza flyer with prices that, when viewed from a distance, strangely resembled Thai script. The combination of vertically elongated numbers and the symbols \"S, M, L\" created this optical illusion. The post garnered over 140,000 likes, with many social media users agreeing that it indeed looked like Thai language, sparking amusement and shared laughter online.\n\nTitle: Effortless Biryani Made in a Rice Cooker with Basmati Rice and Ready-Made Curry?\nLink: https://togetter.com/kiji/2024/02/19/132361\nArticle:\nA user on Twitter, Maillot_Joyu (@Maillot_Joyu), shared an experiment where they created Biryani by cooking Basmati rice with a ready-made curry and butter in a rice cooker. The result was surprisingly good, looking and tasting like authentic Biryani. The author of the post also tried this method, using a ready-made \"Go Go Curry\" and found that the flavor of the curry and butter infused well with the Basmati rice, creating a dish with a rich, spicy aroma that matched the Biryani taste. This simple cooking method could be a game-changer for those looking to make Biryani at home without the traditional complexity.\n\nTitle: 160,000 People's Inside Jokes｜Ikumi Yasuhiro\nLink: https://note.com/zyasuoki/n/n3719079673a4\nArticle:\nIkumi Yasuhiro wrote about the experience of attending \"Audrey's All-Night Nippon\" in Tokyo Dome. The event was described as unique and unrepeatable, with attendees expressing a blend of admiration, gratitude, and a sense of security that a role model has been established. Despite the grand scale of the event, the essence of it felt exclusive and intimate, with a perfect balance of humor and seriousness. The show maintained its comedic nature throughout, delivering a sense of authenticity and avoiding any feeling of being forced or unnatural. The performance was seen as a historic and grateful theme, yet it cleverly avoided sentimentality, instead embracing a playful, comic book-like representation of gratitude.\n\nTitle: Imuraya Chairman, a Survivor of a Tunnel Train Fire, Focuses on Employee Well-being and Happiness\nLink: https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/66bc0ecba0ca128e1c401e4efc8854be2d0a939e\nArticle:\nThe chairman of Imuraya, a Japanese confectionery company known for its \"Azuki Bar\" ice cream, survived the tragic Hokuriku tunnel train fire in 1972, which claimed 30 lives. This harrowing experience, which forced him to give up his dream of becoming a teacher due to the aftereffects, led him to a life dedicated to others' well-being. His father's words, urging him to live for those who perished, became his lifelong mission. He began working at Imuraya as an accountant and delivery driver, eventually becoming a full-time employee. The company's inclusive culture, which rewards even part-time workers, deeply impressed him. His experience shaped his vision for the company, prioritizing the happiness and active participation of all employees.",

Initially opposed to indiscriminate photography, the priest now believes that having images as records can be beneficial, especially in the event of disaster-related damage or destruction. Photographs can serve as valuable resources for restoration and preservation. The priest's perspective reflects a broader realization of the importance of documenting cultural and religious artifacts, advocating for more open photography practices to ensure their legacy can be preserved through visual records.",

    "article": "In the espionage-laden Cold War era, the CIA faced the challenge of infiltrating spies into the private spaces of heavily guarded foreign dignitaries. Their unique solution was \"Operation Acoustic Kitty,\" where they attempted to use cats as spies. The operation involved investing $20 million (equivalent to 7.2 billion yen at the time) and five years to create a cyborg spy cat equipped with surveillance devices. Despite the ingenuity, the project was abandoned in 1967 due to the independent nature of cats and their inability to stay within the required vicinity to gather intelligence. This story is a testament to the lengths agencies have gone to in the name of espionage, exploring the concept of animal spies, which, while seemingly far-fetched today, was a serious undertaking by the CIA at the time.\n\nTitle: Daihatsu Founder Hirotake Yano Passes Away, Noted for His Modest, Negative Business Outlook\nLink: http://blog.livedoor.jp/nwknews/archives/6113305.html\nArticle:\nHirotake Yano, the founder of the 100-yen shop chain \"Daiso\" operated by major Japanese retail company Daihatsu, has passed away. Yano was known for his humble and often negative views on business, which he expressed through various statements over the years. He had a firm belief that the customer is unpredictable, and he lived with the fear that Daiso could fail due to its shallow business model. Despite his success, Yano maintained a cautious approach, always preparing for the worst-case scenario and expressing a lack of confidence in the company's future. His unorthodox approach to business and life was characterized by a persistent anxiety about failure and a strong commitment to gratitude and hard work.\n\nTitle: JAXA's H3 Rocket Successfully Launched, Overcoming Past Failure\nLink: https://nordot.app/1131383103621694342\nArticle:\nThe Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has successfully launched the second H3 rocket from the Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture at 9:22 AM. The launch included a mock satellite and two ultra-small satellites. This came after the failure of the first rocket's second-stage engine last March. The H3, a liquid-fuel rocket developed by JAXA and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, is poised to be the successor to the current mainstay H2A rocket. With improved ignition systems following the previous failure, the H3's second-stage engine fired correctly, achieving the main objectives of its flight demonstration and reaching the target orbit. The successful separation of the onboard satellites, including Canon Electronics' optical satellite \"CE-SAT-1E,\" marked a significant milestone for the H3 program.\n\nTitle: In Medieval Japan, the Concept of Time Was the Opposite of Today's 'Past Behind, Future Ahead'\nLink: https://togetter.com/li/2317029\nArticle:\nIn an intriguing reflection on cultural perceptions of time, it has been noted that during the medieval period in Japan, the concept of time was quite different from the present-day notion. Unlike the common contemporary image where the past is seen as behind us and the future lies ahead, in medieval Japan, this perspective was reversed. The details of how this conceptualization was expressed and understood in Japanese culture at the time provide a fascinating glimpse into the fluid nature of time perception across different eras and societies.\n\nTitle: An Introduction to Modern Project Management - Understanding KPIs in EVMS\nLink: https://brevis.exblog.jp/30815670/\nArticle:\nThis article delves into the Earned Value Management System (EVMS), a project management tool that goes beyond traditional budget management methods by incorporating the concept of progress. Instead of simply comparing Planned Value (PV) and Actual Cost (AC), EVMS introduces Earned Value (EV) to differentiate between cost and schedule variances. Key performance indicators (KPIs) like Schedule Variance (SV) and Cost Variance (CV) are derived by comparing EV with PV and AC, respectively. Positive SV indicates on-schedule progress, while negative CV points to a budget deficit. The article explains the significance of these metrics and how Project Control uses them, particularly for forecasting a project's \"Cost Estimate at Completion\" (EAC). Through these insights, the article helps clarify the complex dynamics of project management and the importance of tracking progress and costs accurately.",

DoRA works by decomposing a pre-trained model's weight matrix W into a scalar m and a directional matrix V, then applying LoRA to this direction matrix V. This method has shown to be more robust and capable of achieving higher performance with lower rank numbers compared to LoRA, even in large-scale language models like LLaMA-7B. Additionally, DoRA applies weight normalization, a technique presented in 2016, and has been reported to improve prediction accuracy by over 1% compared to LoRA when tested on the lightweight model DistilBERT.",

    "article": "MonotaRO's Platform Engineering Department's Container Infrastructure Group has successfully containerized their monolithic API used behind their e-commerce site and migrated it to Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). After the migration, they faced several issues but have since achieved stable operations. To minimize the impact of application release-induced troubles, they introduced canary releases for the containerized API. They decided not to use ConfigMaps to reduce the cognitive load on developers. The canary releases were implemented using Argo Rollouts, given their existing deployment practices with ArgoCD to Kubernetes clusters. Challenges faced included variations in understanding of work and technology among the team due to the API being modified by numerous teams, a bloated and frequently modified Config, and a complex application release flow involving ConfigMap changes. To address these, they shifted from using Kubernetes ConfigMaps to including the config file in the application repository and made Secrets immutable. This led to a simplified release process for developers and reduced the risk of application errors due to Config/Secret changes.\n\nTitle: What Engineers Should Check in Design Before Starting Development - Qiita\nLink: https://qiita.com/megumu-u/items/f4dc25500f57636ae86a\nArticle:\nAn article on Qiita serves as a reminder for developers on what to check in design documents (like those in Figma) before starting development. It suggests verifying image formats, checking for vector (SVG) or raster images (PNG, etc.), and considering high-resolution images to avoid blurriness on smartphones. Attention should be paid to whitespace to ensure consistency across screens, and decisions on whether to customize or use the default fonts provided by the operating system should be made. The article also covers handling different device sizes and text width overflow, suggesting possible solutions like wrapping text, using ellipses, or resizing fonts. Additionally, it advises confirming the handling of transitions, dark mode support, and whether OS-specific displays like dialogs and scroll bars should follow the design or default appearance.\n\nTitle: \"Galactic Compass\" App Shows the Direction to the Center of the Galaxy\nLink: https://gigazine.net/news/20240219-galactic-compass/\nArticle:\nEntrepreneur Matt Webb has released an iOS app called \"Galactic Compass,\" which points to the center of the Milky Way galaxy, marked by Sagittarius A*. The app, available on the App Store, requires location permissions to operate and displays an arrow pointing to the galaxy's center, located 26,000 light-years away. Holding the device flat is necessary for the compass function to work properly. While the app's practical use may be limited, its significance lies in the fact that Webb created it without knowing how to code in Swift, the programming language for iOS apps. Instead, he utilized ChatGPT to guide him through the development process in Xcode, even incorporating the \"SwiftAA\" library to calculate the distance between the device's location and the center of the galaxy.\n\nTitle: The Charming Floating Homes on the Canals of the Netherlands\nLink: https://dailyportalz.jp/kiji/netherlands-kobune-ouchi\nArticle:\nThe canals in the center of Amsterdam are adorned with numerous small boats, many of which are actually inhabited homes. These houseboats, ranging from old rusty vessels to beautifully painted floating islands, are a unique feature of the city. The author, who had the opportunity to visit Amsterdam for work, shares a collection of photographs of these houseboats. Each boat is a one-of-a-kind creation, often converted from former cargo ships or tugboats into charming living spaces. The article details the author's observations of the boats' exteriors, imagining the lives of their inhabitants and the sense of freedom and autonomy they embody.\n\nTitle: Attaching the Equivalent of AppleVisionPro's Cost in Cash to Goggles\nLink: https://dailyportalz.jp/kiji/apple-vision-pro-500000yen\nArticle:\nThe release of Apple's new goggle-like device, the AppleVisionPro, priced at $3,499 or approximately 524,850 yen, has sparked discussions online. The author of the article humorously attempts to attach 500,000 yen in cash to a pair of similar-looking goggles to mimic the high cost of the new tech. The article recounts the experience of withdrawing the cash and the apprehension felt carrying such a large sum. Despite a planned photo shoot with the cash-laden goggles, the author ultimately decides against it due to the potential risks involved. The article ends with a light-hearted wish that the AppleVisionPro might be sold in Japan for a much lower price in the future.",

This led to a simplified release process for developers and reduced the risk of application errors due to Config/Secret changes.\n\nTitle: What Engineers Should Check in Design Before Starting Development - Qiita\nLink: https://qiita.com/megumu-u/items/f4dc25500f57636ae86a\nArticle:\nAn article on Qiita serves as a reminder for developers on what to check in design documents (like those in Figma) before starting development. It suggests verifying image formats, checking for vector (SVG) or raster images (PNG, etc.), and considering high-resolution images to avoid blurriness on smartphones. Attention should be paid to whitespace to ensure consistency across screens, and decisions on whether to customize or use the default fonts provided by the operating system should be made. The article also covers handling different device sizes and text width overflow, suggesting possible solutions like wrapping text, using ellipses, or resizing fonts. Additionally, it advises confirming the handling of transitions, dark mode support, and whether OS-specific displays like dialogs and scroll bars should follow the design or default appearance.\n\nTitle: \"Galactic Compass\" App Shows the Direction to the Center of the Galaxy\nLink: https://gigazine.net/news/20240219-galactic-compass/\nArticle:\nEntrepreneur Matt Webb has released an iOS app called \"Galactic Compass,\" which points to the center of the Milky Way galaxy, marked by Sagittarius A*. The app, available on the App Store, requires location permissions to operate and displays an arrow pointing to the galaxy's center, located 26,000 light-years away. Holding the device flat is necessary for the compass function to work properly. While the app's practical use may be limited, its significance lies in the fact that Webb created it without knowing how to code in Swift, the programming language for iOS apps. Instead, he utilized ChatGPT to guide him through the development process in Xcode, even incorporating the \"SwiftAA\" library to calculate the distance between the device's location and the center of the galaxy.\n\nTitle: The Charming Floating Homes on the Canals of the Netherlands\nLink: https://dailyportalz.jp/kiji/netherlands-kobune-ouchi\nArticle:\nThe canals in the center of Amsterdam are adorned with numerous small boats, many of which are actually inhabited homes. These houseboats, ranging from old rusty vessels to beautifully painted floating islands, are a unique feature of the city. The author, who had the opportunity to visit Amsterdam for work, shares a collection of photographs of these houseboats. Each boat is a one-of-a-kind creation, often converted from former cargo ships or tugboats into charming living spaces. The article details the author's observations of the boats' exteriors, imagining the lives of their inhabitants and the sense of freedom and autonomy they embody.\n\nTitle: Attaching the Equivalent of AppleVisionPro's Cost in Cash to Goggles\nLink: https://dailyportalz.jp/kiji/apple-vision-pro-500000yen\nArticle:\nThe release of Apple's new goggle-like device, the AppleVisionPro, priced at $3,499 or approximately 524,850 yen, has sparked discussions online. The author of the article humorously attempts to attach 500,000 yen in cash to a pair of similar-looking goggles to mimic the high cost of the new tech. The article recounts the experience of withdrawing the cash and the apprehension felt carrying such a large sum. Despite a planned photo shoot with the cash-laden goggles, the author ultimately decides against it due to the potential risks involved. The article ends with a light-hearted wish that the AppleVisionPro might be sold in Japan for a much lower price in the future.",

When a homeowner requested that the workers keep the front door closed because of their cat, the burly men began relaying messages to each other, saying things like, \"There's a kitty here, so let's keep the door closed,\" and \"We'll close it because of the cat-chan.\" This adorable exchange was well-received online, highlighting the softer side of construction workers and their respect for household pets.

The writer suggests that most aspiring IT professionals will not end up in their desired service companies but are more likely to be confined to less desirable roles in system integration or software engineering services. The path to becoming an IT engineer requires specialized knowledge and is not easily attainable, with a competitive job market that can be more challenging than getting into prestigious universities.

The card, shared by the husband, shows a teacher's comments that humorously shift from high praise in the first term to succinct advice by the third term. Initially lauded for her brightness and effort, the comments later gently encourage her to \"ease up on the power\" and \"listen to others' conversations.\" This compelling change sparks curiosity and amusement among readers. The husband's acknowledgment that the report card perfectly captures his wife's personality adds a touch of endearment to the story. The report card, reflecting the wife's artistic talents in subjects like music and art, also promotes their current venture where the wife's casual drawings are sold as merchandise.",

This suit follows a criminal complaint filed against Ito and his trainer for an incident in a hotel in Osaka where they were accused of non-consensual sexual acts with two women who were intoxicated and unconscious. The lawsuit aims to seek compensation for the damages caused by the allegations, which began with the Shukan Shincho article.

    "article": "The legal representatives of Japanese national football player Junya Ito have filed a civil lawsuit at the Osaka District Court against two women, demanding over 200 million yen in damages. Ito's legal team, led by attorney Hirotaro Kato, claims the lawsuit was necessary due to the women's actions, which included recording and publicizing a police report and filing charges during the Asian Cup. The legal action aims to restore Ito's honor after allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced, impacting his social standing and career. The police investigation is said to be progressing rapidly, challenging initial estimates that it could take up to a year to resolve.\n\nTitle: Girlfriend Seeks Advice on Winning Boyfriend's Attention at Disney, Competes with Unexpected Rival\nLink: https://togetter.com/li/2317438\nArticle:\nA playful plea for advice on social media reveals a girlfriend's struggle to win her boyfriend's attention at Disney, not from another woman or a smartphone game, but from his car's full titanium muffler.

As the show comes to an end this fiscal year, a cultural anthropologist suggested a show where a woman lectures a man could balance the dynamic. However, Hasegawa argued that \"Buratamori\" is a rare program that avoids a didactic style, instead presenting host Tamori with challenging geographic puzzles and expert follow-ups. He emphasized Tamori's uniqueness in the industry and his aversion to flaunting knowledge to younger people.\n\nTitle: A Look at the Power and Size of Japanese Horses in Comparison to Period Dramas\nLink: https://togetter.com/li/2317062\nArticle:\nA social media post discussing Japanese horses has sparked interest in their actual power and suitability for combat, despite often being portrayed as smaller than their counterparts in period dramas. The user, who dresses in traditional armor and participates in mounted archery, reflects on the perception of samurai height and how modern actors may look unbalanced on native horse breeds, contrary to the impression given by their powerful performance in action.\n\nTitle: Nostalgia for a Local Kamen Rider Show\nLink: https://anond.hatelabo.jp/20240218182628\nArticle:\nA nostalgic recollection details a local Kamen Rider show that took place about 20 years ago in Oita at the Yawata Steel Works. The show featured classic riders like 1, V3, RX, and possibly Blade, though the author's memory is hazy. Despite being aimed at children, the event attracted an older fan who remembers the odd combination of characters and the abrupt end due to bad weather. The unresolved story of the show still lingers in the author's mind two decades later.",

    "article": "Nintendo has reportedly informed major game publishers that the launch of its next-generation console, tentatively named Nintendo Switch 2, will be delayed to 2025. Initially rumored to release in 2024, the new timeline suggests the successor to the popular Nintendo Switch may arrive in the first quarter of 2025. Speculation about the delay points to Nintendo's desire to prepare powerful first-party software for the new device. The Nintendo Switch 2 has been in development for some time, with its existence hinted at in various reports and its hardware features demonstrated to developers. Activision Blizzard has commented that the power of the upcoming console is comparable to the PS4 and Xbox One. Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa had previously denied rumors about the Switch 2, stating that official plans would be shared at a later financial briefing.\n\nTitle: Yokohama's Cosmo Clock 21 Ferris Wheel to Feature Gundam Illuminations\nLink: https://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/2402/19/news172.html\nArticle:\nYokohama's iconic Cosmo Clock 21 Ferris wheel will begin showcasing illuminations of the famous \"Mobile Suit Gundam\" characters, including the \"moving Gundam\" and \"Haros,\" starting February 26th. This initiative by the city of Yokohama aims to celebrate the final days of \"GUNDAM FACTORY YOKOHAMA,\" which will end on March 31st. The light shows, featuring every 15 minutes from 6:30 pm to 9:31 pm until the closing date, are designed to enhance the experience for Gundam fans. Mid-March will also see various related photo spots throughout the city and a collaboration with the \"Minato Mirai STREET MUSIC\" event, where artists will perform live music from the Gundam series.\n\nTitle: MOVeLOT Seeks Sponsors for Piloted 'Patlabor' Robot\nLink: https://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/2402/19/news159.html\nArticle:\nMOVeLOT, a Tokyo-based robotics venture, has announced its search for sponsors and suppliers for the development and operation of a piloted \"Ingram\" robot from the upcoming anime \"Mobile Police Patlabor EZY.\" Sponsorship plans range from 5 to 30 million yen, with the highest tier offering up to five days of free lending of the completed Ingram unit. Suppliers will be chosen based on the components they provide. MOVeLOT specializes in developing manned robot attractions for entertainment and events. The \"Patlabor EZY\" production, announced in 2017, is directed by Yuuki Masami of HEADGEAR and aims for release around summer, with the exact premiere date yet to be decided.\n\nThe last two news items about \"Daddy Debadi\" and \"Spider-Man: Octopus Girl\" from the Shonen Jump+ platform do not provide sufficient context for a summary article.

    "article": "The author recently visited the printing factory of Shimaya Publishing, a company that specializes in printing doujinshi, or self-published works. Doujinshi printing facilities cater to small-scale productions, offering personalized attention to detail that might not be common knowledge to the general public. They provide services like color management and suggestions for print quality improvements, which are essential for creators who may not be familiar with the printing process.\n\nThe article discusses the various stages of printing, including data checks, preprocessing, printing, cutting, inspection, and binding. The printing factory is equipped with specialized machinery for each step, handled by professionals.\n\nShimaya Publishing also offers unique printing options such as on-demand printing, which includes rare ink colors like invisible red, which only shows under UV light, and cold foil processing for foil stamping. They have developed techniques to make ink less prone to smudging and support various other printing methods like offset printing, risograph printing, and laser cutting.\n\nThe visit was illuminating for the author, providing insights into the complexities of the printing process and the capabilities of Shimaya Publishing.

Those who choose to stay overnight to secure early entry to the event are identified, made to pay a fine of 50,000 won (approximately $45), and are given a crown to wear. Accompanying the crown, they also receive a flag that reads \"I queued overnight,\" which they must carry while entering the event.\n\nThe information provided does not detail the reasons behind this policy or how it is enforced, but it suggests an attempt by event organizers to discourage the practice of overnight queuing. This practice could be seen as a safety measure or a way to ensure fairness among attendees. However, it also raises questions about the treatment of dedicated fans and the culture of doujinshi events where early access to merchandise or exclusive items can be highly sought after.",
