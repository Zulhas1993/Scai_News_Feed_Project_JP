        "Othello is not a game that originated in Japan | Koryu Kato @Kanare_Abstract Login Register Othello is not a game that originated in Japan No. 304\nKoryu Kato@Kanare_Abstract January 11, 2024 08:01 At the end of last year, I posted the following entry related to the news of the Othello solution. \nIn terms of content is a light essay, but when I searched online for materials related to Othello in order to write this, I found things like ``Othello is a game that originated in Japan'' and ``Othello is a thorny game.'' I noticed that I frequently came across posts and pages that said things like 'a game that originated in Mito City, Castle Prefecture,' and I started to feel a little confused. Briefly, because it's wrong. The origin of Othello is written in great detail on Wikipedia, which everyone should check first, with numerous sources.\n. \nOthello (board game) - Wikipedia ja.wikipedia.org\nIf you have read this text, at least Othello was created in Japan without any relation to the previous game. I think it's easy to tell that it's not an original game, but since it's well-written, perhaps not many people read the text properly. No. In the first place, I don't know if this Wikipedia article itself is out of consideration for the people involved, but it seems like there are various theories by listing things with completely different objectivity. It seems that the information that has been carefully examined has been distorted and disseminated. Note: The following is the content of the Wikipedia article on Othello. is based on the content as of the time this note was posted (January 11, 2024). Please note that this may be modified later. Those who find it troublesome to read the main text The following is a summary of the main points regarding the origin of Othello in the Wikipedia article. Othello was developed by Goro Hasegawa in 1973. Released by Kuda. The name comes from Shakespeare's ``Othello.'' A game similar to Othello was invented in England around 1890 as ``Reversi.'' It was popular. Reversi in the early 20th century had almost the same rules as modern Othello, including the shape of the board and the rules for when there is no starting place (The only difference is that there were multiple local rules in the initial arrangement). Reversi has been introduced to Japan since the Meiji period and is known under names such as ``Genpei Go.'' Ta. Its rules, described in the World Game Encyclopedia (1907), are exactly the same as Othello, including the rules for initial placement. 'Genpei Go' (= Reversi) was commercialized by Hanayama before the release of Othello. Goro Hasegawa himself saw his older brother playing Genpei Go when he was young, and when Othello was first released, He clearly stated that Genpei Go was the prototype for Othello. Prior to the commercialization of Othello, Hasegawa submitted a utility model application in 1971 as an 'improvement of Genpei Go.' Around the year 2000, Hasegawa suddenly began to say that Othello was based on a game he had invented called Pincer Go, and published his official website. Descriptions such as '''', etc.'' also come to conform to this statement. As a supplement about the 'initial arrangement', Othello has black pieces and white pieces arranged in a cross shape in the space in the center of the board. The game begins after placing the Reversi in the same way as Othello, depending on the manufacturer, some in the same cross arrangement as Othello, some in the parallel arrangement, and some in the middle without being arranged in advance. There was one in which pieces were placed in order in the center space to decide whether to place them crosswise or in parallel. In short, 'a game with the exact same rules as Othello' is River. So it originally existed as a version of shi. Now, a game with matching rules already existed as a British game over half a century ago. Not only was it introduced to Japan and commercialized, but there is irrefutable evidence that the developer of Othello himself was familiar with the game. What on earth is this? Is there any room for it to be called a 'game that originated in Japan'? In fact, the opinion of a third party (researcher) introduced in the Wikipedia article is also “Othello There isn't enough originality to call it a game independent of Reversi.'' On the other hand, the opinion that insists on the uniqueness of Othello is If you look closely, all of the information is written by Mr. Hasegawa himself or written by the distributor (Megahouse). Mr. Hasegawa and Megahouse said, 'Othello is different from Reversi in Japan and Germany.' He is a stakeholder who is in a position to increase the brand value of Othello by making it his own game and gain direct benefits from it, and he is willing to Since there is a motive to assert the uniqueness of Othello, it is originally inappropriate to put these opinions in the same qualification as third-party opinions and summarize them as 'there are various theories' or 'controversies.' It should be fine. If we look at the content of the article honestly, the reality is that developers and distributors are unilaterally insisting on their uniqueness and are being criticized by multiple experts. I don't know. In particular, Mr. Hasegawa's later claims not only directly contradict his statements at the time of the release, but also contradict the physical evidence of the utility model that he submitted. According to common sense, it is not reliable. Despite this, the Wikipedia article puts all of these on the same page and states that there are various theories. Therefore, it gives the impression that it is safe to say that it originated in Japan. This means that writing both theories together is not necessarily a neutral way of writing. This is a good example of the fact that there are no limitations. The preferred way to write on Wikipedia is that parts based on Goro Hasegawa's testimony and the seller's description are 'developer's claims.' I think it should be more clearly separated from descriptions and criticisms from other third parties. Expressions such as “There is a dispute” or “Dispute” Even now, in response to the opinion that it is not unique, it should be avoided unless there is an influential third party who clearly asserts its originality. Othello One of the reasons why this type of hype is so pervasive is that games have two aspects: a 'product' and a 'system.' This seems to be due to the duality that there is. The game system (rules) of Othello is Reversi, and 'Othello' is actually a version of Reversi. It is simply a rebranding of the original by giving it a different name and a specific design. However, the branding of 'Othello' was a huge success and spread all over the world. As a result, Othello's name, green board, and black and white double-sided disks came to be recognized as an integral part of the game system. For example, from the sentence 'Othello was released in 1973,' there is a risk of misreading that the 'pinch and flip game rule' was first introduced in 1973. The earth comes out. Drawing by the author. When the average person hears that 'Othello is a game that originated in Japan,' they think that the entire system, including the system (inside the red frame), originated in Japan. The only thing made by Japan is the outermost part of the product design. So, if we consider 'Othello' as a product name, is it not wrong to say that it 'originated in Japan'? Well, even from the literal meaning of 'origin', it would be inappropriate. The essential part of a game is the system, not the exterior, and the origin of the game is the game. It is natural to think of it as the origin of game systems rather than specific equipment for games. Moreover, it is a product for which a Japanese company continues to hold a license. Is it natural to use words such as 'origin' to describe things that are not important? Above all, Mr. Hasegawa and MegaHouse recognized River for a while. In addition to concealing the origins of Shi, the official government is spreading information such as 'Mr. Hasegawa's invention' and 'originating in Japan' by covering up the 'prototype' that was added later. I believe that the attitude of individuals and companies cannot escape the stigma of dishonesty. Othello is a remerchandised version of Reversi, which originated in England, and was given a different name, becoming a big hit and becoming a worldwide hit. It has spread throughout the world. This alone is an important contribution by Japanese people to the history of gaming, and is a source of pride for Japan. However, the origin of Othello The people who support claims such as 'Othello is a uniquely Japanese game, different from Reversi,' cover up the fact that it is a British game with a name based on a British literary work. By adding a prefix to the game and insisting that it is a game that originated in Japan, you will be complicit in the ridiculous act of complacency. Then, it is a matter of great pride for Japan's cultural history. I think it could be embarrassing rather than embarrassing. \nOthello (Shincho Bunko) amzn.to 539 yen (as of December 28, 2023 13:47 Click here for details) Purchase on Amazon.co.jp\nKanare_Abstract - Kanare Abstract Kanare_Abstract kanare-abstract.com\n*Image does not purchase licensed images unless otherwise noted.
