    "article": "After the Noto Peninsula earthquake in Japan, local authorities have been requesting that non-residents refrain from visiting the affected areas. This call is issued to prevent disruptions in the ongoing relief and recovery efforts. Disaster-stricken areas often struggle with limited resources, and an influx of visitors can strain the already overwhelmed infrastructure and support systems. The authorities' priority is to ensure that aid and resources are directed to those most in need—namely, the victims of the disaster. By asking the public to stay away, they are also attempting to avoid additional traffic that can hinder emergency services and rescue operations. The request also serves to prevent sightseers, who may obstruct or complicate the work of rescue and recovery teams. Overall, the plea is a measure to maintain order and efficiency in the face of a natural disaster.",
