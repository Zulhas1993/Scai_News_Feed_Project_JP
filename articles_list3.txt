    "article": "A recent survey shows a significant rise in preference for cats as leaders, with 84% in December and now an additional 8 points higher. The main reason given for choosing cats is their independence and strong leadership, as they are not swayed by others and persist in their willfulness. There's a growing acceptance of cats in roles such as construction work, which may influence this perception. Following cats, dogs, dolphins, and monkeys are preferred for their intelligence, with most people believing these animals to be smarter than humans. Human leaders ranked lowest at 0.2%, a sharp decline from the previous 5%, marking the lowest in survey history. Political analyst Sakamoto Giyotai suggests the rise of generative AI and recent political scandals have highlighted human deficiencies in intelligence and character. Japan's constitution does not prohibit non-human prime ministers, and with the Japanese people's resilience to unfair taxation and burden, the concept of a \"cat prime minister\" might be more acceptable than previously thought.",

    "article": "In an analysis by Alexandre Devcchio, the decline of Western power is attributed to three main factors. First, the perceived weakness in American industrial power is highlighted by the inflated figures in the U.S. GDP, revealing a decline in actual industrial strength since 1965, exacerbated by an insufficient number of trained engineers and an overall decline in education standards.\n\nSecondly, the disappearance of Protestant culture in the U.S. is seen as a downfall, with Devcchio's book serving as a sequel to Max Weber’s \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism.\" Weber had identified the development of the Protestant world, including the UK, U.S., Germany, and the Nordic countries, as central to Western prosperity. Protestant nations historically had unprecedentedly high education levels, driven by the need for every believer to read the Bible, which also fostered a strong work ethic and moral standards.\n\nHowever, the negative aspects of Protestant culture, such as racial discrimination in the U.S. and Germany, are acknowledged. The divide between the damned and the chosen in Protestant thought led to the abandonment of the Catholic notion of universal equality.\n\nDevcchio concludes that the recent dissolution of Protestant culture has led to a decline in intellectual standards, a loss of industrious will, and the rise of greed (termed neoliberalism), steering the West towards decline rather than progress.",

    "title": "むしろ全くオススメ出来ないアニメを教えて欲しい",
    "article": "A critic shares their strong disapproval of the anime \"Serial experiments lain,\" labeling it as not recommended for viewers. The anime's protagonist is criticized for being a stereotypical otaku-targeted character—small, shy, and excessively involved with computers and the internet, even causing concern among peers. Dressed in a bear onesie to seemingly appeal to otaku culture, the character is part of the critic's reasons for disapproval. Additionally, the anime's storytelling, which heavily involves internet history and depicts a parallel world of darkness as if it were an urban legend, is considered pretentious and hard to recommend. The setting's ambiguous timeframe, neither fitting a retro-future aesthetic nor a clear vision of the near future, adds to the critic's list of negatives. The narrative's exploration of the main character's increasing detachment from reality due to internet addiction and her eventual realization of her place in the real world is also viewed unfavorably. The critic compares the anime unfavorably to the movie \"Ready Player One,\" suggesting \"Serial experiments lain\" fails to deliver a satisfying experience. The opening and ending themes are also criticized for their melancholic lyrics and unsettling tune, which the critic feels are perfectly critical for the intended audience but not commendable. Lastly, the anime's lack of direct stimulation, moderate cult popularity, and melancholic mood leave the critic feeling that recommending it would be impossible for them.",

    "title": "日経平均株価、取引時間中の最高値上回る　一時3万9000円台 - 日本経済新聞",
    "article": "On the 22nd, the Nikkei Stock Average on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rebounded, momentarily reaching over 39,000 yen, surpassing the peak of the bubble economy on December 29, 1989, with an intraday high of 38,957 yen. The increase reflects improved earnings power of listed companies, corporate governance reforms, and expectations of exiting deflation. This has led to a reassessment of Japanese stocks, with continued inflows of foreign investor funds.\n\nThe Nikkei average rose over 700 yen from the previous day, driven by strong earnings from U.S. semiconductor giant Nvidia, which boosted semiconductor-related stocks. Stocks related to semiconductors and artificial intelligence (AI), such as Tokyo Electron and SoftBank Group, have been leading the gains since the beginning of the year.\n\nBy the end of 2023, the Nikkei average had risen over 5,000 yen, with a growth rate of 17%, significantly outperforming major Western indices such as the U.S. S&P 500 Index. The market capitalization of the Tokyo Stock Exchange Prime Market increased by about 90 trillion yen in 2024.\n\nThe current stock rally was initially sparked by strong corporate earnings and further fueled by shareholder return measures such as stock buybacks. A notable turning point for the stock surge was the visit of famous U.S. investor Warren Buffett to Japan in the spring of 2023, which encouraged foreign investors to reconsider investing in Japanese stocks. Foreign investors bought 3.1 trillion yen of Japanese stocks in 2023, with the purchase amount exceeding 2 trillion yen in 2024.\n\nGovernance reforms in Japanese companies have also supported the positive reassessment. Expectations for improved capital efficiency grew after the Tokyo Stock Exchange's March 2023 call for improvements in companies with a price-to-book ratio (PBR) below one. Zuhair Khan of Swiss investment firm UBP Investments praised the fundamental improvements in business portfolios and investment decisions, as well as increased shareholder returns through higher dividends and stock buybacks.\n\nThe introduction of the new NISA (Nippon Individual Savings Account) system at the beginning of the year, with an expanded investment cap and a permanent tax exemption period, has also been a supportive factor, attracting personal investments, particularly among younger generations, into stocks with higher expected dividend yields.\n\nThe Nikkei average has risen along with Japan's economic growth, reaching its then-highest level in December 1989 before the bubble burst. After the collapse of the bubble and hitting the post-bubble low of 7,054 yen in March 2009 following the Lehman shock, the index has been lifted by economic policies such as \"Abenomics\" under the administration of Shinzo Abe.",

    "article": "A recent Fuji TV program review committee meeting has sparked controversy due to comments suggesting that heightened awareness of human rights could lead to dull television and stifle creativity. The discussion, which focused on \"Television and Human Rights,\" prompted criticisms on social media, with users defending the protection of participant rights and dismissing any link between human rights and entertainment value. The mother of Hana Kimura, a female professional wrestler who passed away while appearing on a Fuji TV show, criticized the committee's attitude on Twitter, implying that such stances can lead to loss of life.\n\nHuman rights lawyer Ryo Ogawa commented on the issue, criticizing committee members for being out of touch with the public and failing to understand the societal role and responsibility of the media. He emphasized that media should respect human rights and serve as watchdogs for power, democracy, and truth, rather than succumbing to rating and sponsor pressures. Ogawa also highlighted the need for the media to provide valuable information and to embrace their social role, particularly in light of increasing global awareness of human rights and climate change issues.",

    "article": "Concerns have been raised about the gender imbalance and the solidification of roles in evacuation shelters, where cooking duties often fall disproportionately on women. The article describes a man's experience of feeling out of place while trying to help with cooking in a family gathering, where women, including his grandmother, aunts, mother, and sister, were efficiently preparing food while chatting. He recalls being told to sit down and not help, a situation he believes is similar in evacuation shelters. Despite being willing to assist, he feels that he cannot match the expertise of women, particularly older ones, who have extensive experience with household chores. He speculates that if only men were present, the tasks would still get done, albeit probably not to the same standard. The writer muses on different gender compositions in cooking scenarios, suggesting that men feel they become a hindrance when outnumbered by women. He concludes by reflecting on the need for team experience in cooking, comparing it to his lack of skill in team sports and contrasting it with a successful school cooking class where everyone was a novice.",

    "article": "A manager is facing a dilemma with a new employee who excessively reports every minor detail to the point of disrupting workplace efficiency. Initially, the manager appreciated the subordinate's thorough reporting habit, but as the employee settled into the company culture, the practice became excessive. The employee reports trivial matters, like running out of tissues in the conference room, and asks for guidance on even the smallest issues. This behavior has extended to them adding their personal touch to tasks, which complicates matters and affects other departments. An example given is when the employee was allowed to manage the reception desk for a month, which resulted in an overabundance of handwritten signs directing visitors, compared to an overly stickered coffee machine in a convenience store. The employee is constantly seeking \"improvement points,\" often presenting misaligned solutions. Colleagues have urged the manager to intervene, but the manager struggles to articulate the appropriate level of reporting in writing. The manager seeks advice on how to manage the situation effectively.",

    "article": "With the introduction of the new NISA (tax-exempt investment accounts), stock investment has become an increasingly interesting option for individuals looking to manage their assets. While stock investment may seem daunting to beginners, driven by the appeal of dividends and shareholder perks, a Nintendo fan named Alex decided to purchase shares to attend the exclusive shareholder meetings. Alex expressed that attending the meetings deepened the attachment to the company.\n\nAlex, who has run a Nintendo fan site for over 20 years, shared the experience of being a Nintendo shareholder. From childhood, Alex enjoyed Nintendo games and later created a fan site to engage with like-minded enthusiasts. When the Wii U's lackluster performance led to a drop in Nintendo's share price, Alex saw it as an opportunity to invest in the company and subsequently attended nine shareholder meetings.\n\nThese meetings are held in Kyoto and offer attendees gifts such as branded towels and cookies, although some perks have been reduced in recent years. Alex noted that many attendees are fans who ask engaging questions about the company's future, creating an environment that's less like a formal meeting and more like a fan club gathering.\n\nWhile the main benefit of holding shares is often dividends, Alex also enjoys the personal connection to Nintendo, considering the shares to be more of a \"ticket to the shareholder meeting\" rather than a financial investment. Alex concludes that investing in a favored company's shares can be rewarding and suggests that others might also find this form of investment appealing, particularly now with the tax benefits offered by the new NISA.",
